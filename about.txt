This simulation primarily makes use of two objects: computers and sensors.
Each of these objects is a node in the sensor network. Nodes maintain lists
of their 'incoming neighbors' and their 'outgoing neighbors'. At node i, an
incoming neighbor is a node that sends information to node i and an outgoing
neighbor is a node that receives information from node i. 

Computers must maintain their own clock.
